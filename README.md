# first-order-laplacian
Code to accompany the paper "First-Order Algorithms for Optimization over Graph Laplacians"

To generate the synthetic convergence plots, see the notebooks [here](https://github.com/twmaunu/first-order-laplacian/blob/main/experiments_conv.ipynb) and [here](https://github.com/twmaunu/first-order-laplacian/blob/main/experiments_conv_proj.ipynb).
